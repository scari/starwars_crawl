File Format of Compressed Bitmap Font
=====================================


Notes:
* Numbers in the left column are byte counts.
* All multibyte values are little-endian.
* This format is never decompressed; it is designed to be reasonably fast to use in its compressed form.


FILE:
4       glyph height (HEI)
4       highest supported Unicode character + 1 (N)
4*N     file-relative offsets to glyphs; 0 = unused
--      glyphs


GLYPH:
4       glyph width
4*HEI   file-relative offsets to rows
--      rows


ROW:
--      one or more chunks (until glyph width is reached)


CHUNK:
1       fill bytes (if 255, remaining chunk data will be absent) (fill value resets to 0 at start of row, and can be only 0 or 255)
1       raw count (RAW) (if 0, fill value flips from 0 to 255 or vice-versa)
RAW     raw bytes (last byte’s hi-bit determines the new fill value: 0 or 255)
