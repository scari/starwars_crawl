2007.01.20 \'97 0.9.0  initial release\
2007.01.21 \'97 0.9.1  stability bug fix\
2007.01.21 \'97 0.9.2  fixed faint lines that were being left in sky by searchlights (when using \'93Large\'94 image size or larger)\
2007.01.21 \'97 0.9.3  corrected build settings to permit successful execution on PPC Macs\
2007.01.23 \'97 0.9.4  fixed fatal error when user tries to stop a render\
2007.01.24 \'97 0.9.5  fixed bug that causes app to freeze on frame 0 if the destination folder did not exist\
2007.01.24 \'97 0.9.6  fixed bug that caused \'93Stop\'94 button to freeze app\
2007.01.25 \'97 0.9.7  fixed bug that caused opening a file to freeze app  (last 4 fixes were related to an attempt to cure the image-sizing problem with a lock; that lock has been removed, so these freezing issues should be gone now)\
2007.01.28 \'97 0.9.8  (a) fixed bug that caused image to be rendered incorrectly if image size was reduced while preview image was still being generated  /  (b) prevented user from opening a file during full-sequence render\
\
2007.06.03 \'97 0.9.9:\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \'95 European accent characters, and many other missing characters now supported.  Numeric digits allowed in Film Company logo.\
\'95 Intro text color tweaked.  (But font is still incorrect.)\
\'95 Intro text no longer clipping the bottom of the letter \'93g\'94.\
\'95 Star field brightness reduced somewhat.\
\'95 Speed of crawl is now constant \'97 it does not move faster for text longer than the original movie\'92s.\
\'95 The four text fields that can be made editable by choosing one of the two \'93Custom\'94 radio buttons are now not inappropriately made editable by the termination of a render.\
\
2007.07.02 \'97 1.0.0:\
\'95 Warns user about using Desktop as a destination.\
\'95 Intro font corrected.\
\
2007.09.01 \'97 1.0.1:\
\'95 Handles crawls longer than the original movie without fading them out early or scrolling them at an unreadable speed.  (However, those long crawls may not sync with the movie music; this is unavoidable.)  Adjusts the color-bar immediately below the progress bar so it matches the proportions caused by a longer-than-normal crawl.\
\
2007.11.21 \'97 1.0.2:\
\'95 Allows a user-typeable Title logo, instead of the static \'93STAR WARS\'94 logo in prior versions.  Also, its glyphs more precisely match the shape of the original movie\'92s logo.\
\
2007.11.24 \'97 1.0.3:\
\'95 Responsiveness of user interface seriously improved during rendering of large preview images.\
\'95 App now uses about one tenth as much processor when idle (but still not zero as is eventually planned).\
\'95 Opening a user file during preview-image render now does not cause damage to the image-rendering process; it resets correctly.\
\'95 Crawl size limit now extended to 10,000 characters (formerly 2,000).\
\'95 When reading user file, Title now defaults to \'93Star Wars\'94 if no Title field is found.  This ensures backward compatibility with older files.\
\
2007.12.08 \'97 1.0.4:\
\'95 Title logo now moves off to distance in a manner more like it did in the original movie.\
\'95 Distributor backdrop now scales well up to full-HD (1920) resolution.\
\
2008.02.09 \'97 1.0.5:\
\'95 Effectiveness of multi-processing dramatically improved (previously was zero or worse \'97 yikes).\
\'95 Full support of Undo/Redo, with undo-past-save warning.\
\'95 Unused menu option \'93New\'94 now removed.\
\'95 Tabbing and shift-tabbing from field to field now works even in multi-line fields (Intro and Crawl).\
\'95 Responsiveness of UI during render slightly improved through better handling of image window update frequency.\
\'95 Parsing of Distributor rows slightly improved.\
\'95 Crawl now handles any combination of CR and LF characters correctly.\
\'95 Crawl now centers any single line of text, but makes such a line double-height only if it\'92s all uppercase.  (Note:  To allow user to control exact positioning of text, lines that start with spaces are not auto-centered.)\
\'95 Crawl no longer flickers badly in the far distance in a letterboxed image.\
\'95 Now uses zero CPU when idle.\
\'95 Rich text now disallowed in all text fields (as it needed to be).\
\'95 Distributor logo now recognizes letter combination \'93Mc\'94 and uses a small \'93c\'94.\
\'95 Distributor searchlights slowed down to move more like the authentic theater logo.\
\'95 Problem where stars occasionally clustered in a thin band in the middle of the image is probably solved.  [Update 2008.12.05:  not solved; cause unknown]\
\
2008.02.10 \'97 1.0.6:\
\'95 Film Company gaussian aura blur now uses the correct aspect for the current image size.\
\
2008.02.11 \'97 1.0.7:\
\'95 Cured major stability bug.\
\
2008.02.12 \'97 1.0.8:\
\'95 Fixed bad pointer in file-open code.\
\
2008.02.12 \'97 1.0.9:\
\'95 Fixed uninitialized string, possibly curing stability bug.  (Update:  Stability bug persists.)\
\
2008.02.19 \'97 1.1.0:\
\'95 Stability bug traced down to one-byte deficit in xmlSafe\'92s string buffer.  Fixed \'97 stability issue appears to be cured.\
\
2008.02.21 \'97 1.1.1:\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused app to sometimes think user-file needs to be saved immediately after file-open.\
\'95 Fixed bug that occasionally caused inappropriate line-wrapping and/or centering at the end of a single line or a paragraph.\
\
2008.02.24 \'97 1.1.2:\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused app to become confused if user clicks in any of the Content tab\'92s fields during a full-sequence render.\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused a mismatch between the user-content fields and the image previews when user opened the app by dragging a user-file onto it.\
\'95 Added \'93render completed\'94 alert box on full-sequence render completion.\
\
2008.03.21 \'97 1.1.3:\
\'95 \'93ask\'94 method reversed so that its \'93yes\'94 and \'93no\'94 responses correctly correspond to the meanings of \'93yes\'94 and \'93no.\'94  Note that this change is transparent to the user \'97 it is for the benefit of developers only.\
\'95 Fixed mysterious bug that caused app to immediately crash after \'93I Agree\'94 on a minority of Macs.\
\
2008.05.03 \'97 1.1.4:\
\'95 Fixed bug that cause searchlights to render incorrectly on PPC Macs.  (The solution was to define \'93bool\'94 as long instead of char when compiling for PPC.  Perhaps char was causing problems due to the 4-byte alignment of the PPC architecture.  bool is defined by Xcode when compiling the .m files, so it may be using a 4-byte value there, which could cause conflicts.)\
\'95 Due to an update to my version of Xcode, SWTSG no longer runs on any version of Mac OS X prior to 10.4 \'93Tiger\'94.  (However, it could theoretically be compiled under an older version of Xcode and then run fine on OS X 10.3 "Panther".)\
\
2008.10.13 \'97 1.1.5:\
\'95 Infrastructure reworked to provide theoretical support for any Unicode characters.\
\'95 Actual support added for these six Unicode characters:  \uc0\u269 , \u268 , \'9a, \'8a, \'9e, and \'8e (plus all non-ASCII characters already supported in the Mac Roman set).\
\'95 This character corrected in the Title font:  \'ca\
\'95 User files (.swtsg files) are now true XML, not just XML-like.  Backward compatibility with pre-1.1.5 user files maintained.\
\'95 Minor code and comment corrections (e.g. spelling of SpecialCaseCharsUpper prototype corrected).\
\'95 Use of NSString\'92s deprecated methods \'93lossyCString\'94 and \'93stringWithCString\'94 has been eliminated.  (Note:  stringWithCString:encoding: is used, but is not deprecated.)\
\
2008.10.19 \'97 1.1.6:\
\'95 Overscan resolution of the Title image re-adjusted for each frame, to greatly reduce flickering as the Title moves into the far distance.\
\
2008.11.13 \'97 1.1.7:\
\'95 Many non-Mac-Roman characters added:  I with dot accent, D with stroke, A with breve, A with ogonek, C acute, D with caron, E with caron, E with ogonek, G with breve, L acute, L with caron, L with slash, N acute, O double-acute, R acute, R with caron, S acute, S with cedilla, S with comma accent, T with caron, T with comma accent, U double-acute, U with ring, Z acute, Z with dot accent, eth, Y acute, and thorn.\
\
2008.11.16 \'97 1.1.8:\
\'95 Option created to allow user to select a custom starfield image.\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused some alert messages to fail to display.\
\
2008.11.21 \'97 1.1.9:\
\'95 Minor bug fixed in frame BMP-creation code; individual frame files now can be opened in Preview, Pixelmator, and other apps that previously refused to open these files.\
\
2008.12.10 \'97 1.2.0:\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused newly opened user files to have the incorrect setting of the custom-starfield file chooser (enabled vs. disabled).\
\
2009.09.21 \'97 1.2.1:\
\'95 Fixed bug that caused the preview image to lock up immediately upon launch in OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\
\
2010.09.11 \'97 1.2.2:\
\'95 Added lower-case "e" to Distributor font, to support Fran\'e7ais \'931er\'94, \'932e\'94, etc.\
\
2011.03.08 \'97 1.2.3:\
\'95 Distributor image gutted under Fox legal threat.\

\cf0 Known bugs in current release:\
\
\'95 Preview image is very gray for reasons unknown \'97 this effect first appeared when compiling for 64-bit.  The rendered BMPs are not affected.\
\'95 About-box does not close on Cmd-W.\
\'95 If user-selected custom starfield image is not the same dimensions as the render, it is scaled using crudest, "nearest pixel" method.  Probably should be replaced with a quality linear or cubic scaling technique.\
\'95 App thinks new (unmodified) default logos have been changed and need to be saved \'97 it should not.\
\'95 When the user resizes the image, the image window comes to the front, but the control window is still selected in the Windows menu.\
\'95 Distribution of stars in star-field may need more tweaking to better match original movie look.  Stars may need some amount of random color (they are currently grayscale only).\
\'95 Crawl text may be the wrong font.  Need to verify exact font.\
\'95 Precise qualities of Film Co animation may not match original closely enough (e.g., color changes, brushed-metal look in core, size and shape of sparkles).\
\'95 All-caps subtitle (immediately below \'93Episode X\'94) should be in a different font, and probably stretched more than 2 line heights.\
\'95 Control window should allow closing, which should be treated the same as Cmd-Q (Quit).\
\'95 Distributor logo text parsing needs to be re-thought.  (example:  \'93This is a test\'94 or \'93Century of the Fruitbat\'94.  Workaround:  Enter \'93Century of_the Fruitbat\'94.)  (developer note:  create iterative procedure that attacks worst-offender lines.)\
\'95 \'93\'b5\'94 glyph can distort badly in Film Co logo.\
\'95 When rendering full sequence, app needs a progress bar superimposed over its dock icon.\
\'95 Distributor font\'92s \'93B\'94 glyph is awkwardly shaped.\
\'95 App seems to acquire extra threads once a full-sequence render has been launched.  These might be created by the OS for purposes unknown.  Normally, the app should have 1 thread when idle, and 1+N threads when rendering, where N is the number of processor cores.  (Thankfully, these mystery threads seem to use no processor when the app is idle.)\
\'95 Destination folder should be automatically created if it doesn\'92t already exist (with ask-the-user-first dialog).}
